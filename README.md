CMustache
=========

The C Mustache Library for "logic-less templating". Mustache is a very simple
template language designed to be logic less- i.e. no if statements, else clauses
or for loops. Instead their are only tags.

CMustache provides a C library and command line interface for processing
Mustache templates.

For more please read [the manual](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html).
